            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[10] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, 
                a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. 
                On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central 
                Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, 
                football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, 
                Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[11] 
                At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a 
                player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[12] He was greatly affected 
                by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by 
                looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.</p>
                <p>A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. 
                    During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", 
                    the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball 
                    tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.</p>

                    when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years 
                    of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on 
                    their promise.[18] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they 
                    declined to pay for his treatment.[19][20] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him "the best 
                    forward I've ever seen".</p>

                <aside>At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th 
                        minute during a friendly against José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003.[22][35] His performance, creating 
                        two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the 
                        club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.</aside>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <hr>
                <article>Antonela Roccuzzo was born on 26 February 1988, in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. 
                    Antonela was raised along with her two sisters, Carla, and Paula Roccuzzo. On his father's side, he is of Italian and 
                    Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's 
                    side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for 
                    the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and 
                    Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[11] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where 
                    he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who 
                    accompanied him to training and matches.</article>
                    <h2>Becoming a starting eleven player</h2>
                    <article>Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 
                        in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his 
                        first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, 
                        aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive 
                        Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga 
                        and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top 
                        scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived 
                        career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga 
                        and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi 
                        assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for 
                        French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice. 
                        Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August of that year.</article>

        <h2>2004–2013: success at youth level</h2>
        <p>As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.
            Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. He was subsequently included in the squad 
            for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005.In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side,
            senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made 
            his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes 
            for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to 
            shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision. As Messi evolved into one of 
            the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to 
            win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela.[61][397] He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States 
            in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against 
            Colombia. From late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances. After Argentina's 
            unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, 
            Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano.</p>

                <h2>2014–2018: World Cup and Copa América finals</h2>
            <p>Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season 
                with Barcelona.Messi's place in Argentina's Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury 
                in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016.[438] It was later reported that he had suffered 
                a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina's 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 
                June due to concerns regarding his fitness. Following on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into 
                the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018.[</p>

                <h2>2019–2022: Copa América third-place and suspension</h2>
                <p>On 21 May, Messi was included in Scaloni's final 23-man squad for the 2019 Copa América.[483] In Argentina's second 
                    group match on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay. 
                    On 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina's opening group match of 
                    the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.</p>

        <article>Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, 
            playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, 
            both of whom became professional footballers. On 26 February 2023, PSG defeated Marseille 3–0 in Le Classique, with Messi 
            scoring his 700th senior career club goal as well as assisting two goals for Mbappé.[351] On 11 March, PSG defeated Brest 2–1, 
            with Messi setting up a last-minute winner for Mbappé, registering his 300th career assist.[352] On 8 April, he scored and 
            provided an assist in a 2–0 away win over Nice in Ligue 1, which saw him overtake Cristiano Ronaldo as the all-time highest 
            goalscorer in European club football with 702 goals; during the match, he also achieved 1,000 career direct goal contributions 
            at club level.[353][354] On 2 May, Messi was suspended for two weeks and fined after taking an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia 
            with his family as part of a promotional commercial agreement. His visit to Saudi Arabia meant he did not show up to training the 
            previous day following a 3–1 defeat to Lorient.[355] The next day, on 3 May, it was reported that Messi would leave PSG at the end 
            of the season, following the expiry of his contract.[356] Afterwards, several PSG supporters demanded his exit from the club, 
            viewing his absence as evidence of a team not fighting for the shirt, within a context of perceived disconnect between themselves 
            and the club's identity.[357] Two days later, Messi apologised to the club and his teammates for the trip, stating he thought he 
            had a free day after the match [against Lorient], and already had the trip planned, which he had canceled previously.[</article>

                <h2>Family and relationships</h2>
                <hr>
                <article>Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.Messi first 
                    confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges 
                    after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.[644]Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, 
                    Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before 
                    confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[646] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[647] 
                    In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[648] On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a 
                    luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario.[649] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third 
                    child.</article>
                    <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
                    <p>Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that 
                        stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and 
                        finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong 
                        association.In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi 
                        Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[662] It was established in 2007 
                        following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him 
                        to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.</p>
                        <h2>Tax fraud</h2>
                        <p>Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax 
                            havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 
                            and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the 
                            Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears 
                            of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were 
                            handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.
                            [674] Facing the judge, he said, "I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the 
                            lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.</p>
